The files in this subdirectory should be able to be used to compile and
install a driver for the TW6800-series chipset.  In order to do this
compilation, the system being used for compilation should contain the
current kernel sources, or at least the "kernel-headers" and the
"kernel-development" packages (different names may be used for these
on different distrubutions).


Current Status - 13 September 2009 10:30am HK Time
--------------------------------------------------

The basic functionality for using the TW6800 video in "grabdisplay" mode
is reasonably stable.  The "overlay" mode and window clipping are not yet
functional.  There is no support for eeprom, audio or transport stream at
this time.

There is a known problem if the application program tries to dynamically
change the scaling of the captured video.  This can result in loss of
picture, and (at least) some logged error messages.

--------------------------------------------------
16 December 2009
Small enhancement to Makefile for "make insmod"
 - suppressed error message if module was previously loaded
 - added in some modprobe's to assure required helper modules are loaded

26 December 2009
Removed all code trying to implement overlay mode.  Changed capabilites
to show V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_OVERLAY not present.
Removed modules tw68-controls.c, tw68-fileops.c and tw68-input.c.

27 December 2009
Enhanced code to handle cropping, as well as the tw68_set_scale routine.
Adjusted the values in tw68-video's NORM_625_50 to improve xawtv's display.
Changed debug prints in tw68-video.c to provide better granularity
(allow better control over which messages to print).

31 December 2009
Removed source module tw68-ioctls.c
Cleaned up all messages from checkpatch.pl
Adjusted debug levels to further reduce log messages for trouble-free runs
Bumped version number to 0.0.2 :-)

01 January 2010
Re-examined all control register initialisations; took into account all of
the comments from Cavok's previous checking, changed several accordingly, and
removed the comments. Added some amplification to comments on settings.

03 January 2010
Adjusted the values in tw68-video's NORM_525_60 using a very cheap NTSC
camera.
Added code for V4L2_CID_COLOR_KILLER and V4L2_CID_CHROMA_AGC

08 January 2010
Enhanced Makefile to allow for TW68_TESTING (determine whether or not to
include experimental code), and to add a new target "install" to put the
module into the current module directory.

08 January 2010
Fixed warning in tw68-risc.c

09 January 2010
Initialised the GPIO register to fix ghosting on some inexpensive boards -
special thanks to Ben at Sttech for the hardware debugging which isolated
this problem.
Added in a PCI ID for the TW6800 chip.  This is just to allow any users

12 January 2010
Fixed error message from 'make insmod' when module wasn't already loaded.
Set bit DETV of VCNTL1 to fix sync problems on multi-cams/chip.
Changed GPIO init to do 4 bits instead of 3.
Changed set_tvnorm to only write reg if changed.
Removed initialisation of TW68-RESERV2 register, since I didn't know what
it is for.

19 January 2010
Changed debug logging in tw68-core.c to follow tw68-video.c flag settings.
Changed handling of mux switching.  Structure 'dev' now has two fields,
'input' and 'hw_input', which point to details of mux setting for card. When
the v4l2 command to switch input is received, 'input' is changed accordingly.
At the interrupt at the end of the current frame occurs, the hardware is
switched and 'hw_input' is set.
Corrected value for setting of ColorFormatGamma bit.
Added VLOCK and HLOCK to video interrupt handling routine.
Corrected tw_clearb macro definition.
Bumped version number to 0.0.3

22 January 2010
Enhanced code to cater for the TW6800

With great assistance from Robby Cerantola, found and fixed the major spot
that was preventing the TW6800 from synchronizing and starting its display.
This was the fact that the VLOCK and HLOCK bits in the interrupt register are
handled differently in the TW6800.
Added code to save the chip type in the device structure, and to use it for
setting up registers differently for the different Techwell chip types.  Also
did a little cleanup in the interrupt handling code.  Added code within the
tw68_set_scale routine to set different register values depending upon the
chip type (for now, the only register different is h_delay).
Bumped version number to 0.0.4.
